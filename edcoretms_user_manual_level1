Ensure the following information is correct:

This enables official enrollment and funding eligibility.

---

## 6. Managing Course Runs

Administrators can:

- Change trainer
- Change location
- Update schedule
- Control course visibility

Course availability statuses include:

- Available
- Limited
- Full
- Private

---

## 7. Adding Students

Students can be added via three methods:

### Method 1: Enrollment Portal (Recommended)

Students enroll directly via the public enrollment portal.

This ensures accurate initial records.

---

### Method 2: Manual Entry

Administrators can manually add individual students into a course run.

---

### Method 3: Excel Bulk Upload

Administrators can upload multiple students using the Excel import template.

---

## 8. Mandatory Information for Funded Students

For funded courses, the following information is required:

- NRIC / Identification Number
- Date of Birth
- Sponsoring Company (if applicable)

Missing or incorrect data will result in funding calculation errors.

---

## 9. Training Partners Gateway (TPG) Enrollment

Each student must be enrolled into TPG.

Once enrolled, the system receives:

- Enrollment ID
- Accurate funding eligibility
- Correct funding amount

Without TPG enrollment, funding values shown are estimates only (80–90% accuracy).

Best Practice:  
Enroll students into TPG as early as possible.

Compliance requirements:

- Enrollment must be submitted within 14 days from course start date
- Assessment results must be submitted within 14 days from assessment date

---

## 10. Student Profile Management

Navigate to:

- Search by batch
- View full student profile
- Edit student details
- Submit enrollment to TPG

Student profiles contain:

- Funding status

---

## 11. Invoices and Confirmation Notes

The system automatically generates:

- Confirmation notes
- Invoices

These include:

Administrator must manually send the confirmation note.

To send confirmation:

1. Open student profile or batch
2. Click **Send Confirmation Note**

Optional attachments:

Payment methods supported:

- eNETS

---

## 12. Recording Payments

This is critical because:

SSG grant disbursement only occurs after full payment is received and recorded.
